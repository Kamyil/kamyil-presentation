            Hi! I'm Kamil and these are some informations about me. I'm a Front-End Developer for around 2 years,
            1 year as a freelancer and another one as a member of developer team. Creating beautiful and reusable UIs is
            my passion. My main goal in my carrier is to make outstanding, fabulous interfaces
            which are beautiful and easy to use by user, and easly maintainable and reusable by developer. In future I
            would like to become Full Stack Developer also.

            I spend my free time playing on ukulele and learning new things :)

        </p>
        <p class="aboutme__content--self" data-tab-name="technologies" role="contentinfo">
            Currently at work I'm using TypeScript & JQuery & SCSS which is great combination of tools to make
            websites with views made with PHP (unfortunetly). These are compiled by Webpack with Babel, PostCSS and
            images compression included.

            For my individual projects I'm mostly using React & React-Native, but there are also some cases where I have
            to use use Angular or Vue.
            All of them with Typescript included (NG has already built-in ofc.) since I don't get any sense of writing
            production code without static typing.
            In my opinion code without static typing is subject to hard-resolvable bugs.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutme__content--self" data-tab-name="architecture" role="contentinfo">
            In all of my projects I'm building interfaces based on components. In my opinion
            this is the best way to create UI with keeping harmony and clean code in the same time.

            In Angular, Vue and React components are already included, so these frameworks are undoubtable my first
            choice
            to use when it comes to create front-end, but unfortunetly there are also some cases where I cannot use
            them. In this case
            I'm using mini-architecture that you can see right now in my files. In resources/ folder you can see
            TypeScript and SCSS folders with Component subfolders.
            All of these Components are imported into main.(ts/scss) files which later they will be bundled with Webpack
            into 2 separated files: bundle.js and style.css.

        </p>
        <p class="aboutme__content--self" data-tab-name="jquery" role="contentinfo"> Well... what could I say?
            In this project I wanted to show you my way to solve my every-day problems at work, where unfortunetly I
            can't put
            any of these great JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue or Angular, since views of their applications are
            made
            with PHP. In this case I was forced to use JQuery since there is no better framework to use in projects
            without REST API.
            <br><br>
            <b>Why is it the best in my opinion?</b>
            <br><br>

            There are a lot of great jquery-based plugins to use with like Select2, Selectric (this is maybe not great
            at all but at last it's easy to style it), pretty-checkbox etc.
            that help me make apps much faster and easier.
